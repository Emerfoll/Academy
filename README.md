# Emerfoll.Academy
https://emerfoll.academy/

This is the first website I created.

As part of the application process for Prime Digital Academy, I was required to turn my resume into a website. 
This is the result of that process.

It was made using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
It doesn't have much functionality other than displaying my resume information along with links to my social profiles at the bottom of each page.
